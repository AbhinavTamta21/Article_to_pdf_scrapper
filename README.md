# Article_to_pdf_scrapper
This repository contains a cross-platform article scraper application with a modern dark user interface. The application fetches an article from a URL and exports a clean PDF and/or a plain text file. Images are downloaded and embedded in the PDF. For JavaScript-driven sites, the application can optionally render pages using Playwright.
